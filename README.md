## **"I Promise It's Not Malware" Edition**  

Behold! The portfolio of a cybersecurity enthusiast who spends more time:  
- Analyzing malware than socializing  
- Deploying honeypots than dating apps  
- Writing `curl` detection logic than actual love letters  

Built with:  
- **82.1% Vue** *(Because reactive malware analysis is a thing now)*  
- **14.9% JavaScript** *(Mostly for detecting Linux user-agents)*  
- **3% HTML** *(Just enough to trigger Burp Suite alerts)*

## **Featured Projects (That May or May Not Get Me Investigated)**  

### 1. **"Totally Legal" Malware Sandbox**

### 2. **AWS Honeypot (AKA "Hack Me Plz")**

### 4. **Cloudflare `curl` API Trap**  
‚úÖ Anti-bot logic | ‚úÖ Fake tokens | ‚úÖ Pure evil

## **Why This Portfolio?**  
- It‚Äôs **not** a front for an APT group (probably).  
- It **does** have a dark mode (because why not).  
- It **does** have a contact form (because I‚Äôm lonely).

## **Now Lets Talk about some real part "Installation (For Humans & Script Kiddies)"**  
**Dependencies:**  
- `npm` *(because `curl | bash` is too mainstream)*  
- `git` *(to clone)*  
- A terminal that supports `sudo` *(optional but encouraged)*  

**Clone (Legally Questionable Method):**  
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/0xRad1ant/portfolio.git  
$ cd portfolio  
$ npm install  # Installs 127 vulnerable packages (just kidding... probably)  
```

**Run (At Your Own Risk):**  
```bash
$ npm run serve  # Spins up a dev server 
$ npm run build  # Yaaaaay! Build the project (or break it)
```

### **Usage (AKA "How to Not Fck")**  
1. **Edit `info.js`**  
   - Replace my ego with yours.   
   - Configure the **Discord Webhook** in the contact form *(because emails are for normies)*.  

2. **Discord Webhook Setup**  
   - Create a webhook in your Discord server *(name it "FBI Surveillance Channel")*.  
   - Paste the URL in the .env for local and otherwise go check Contact.vue.  
   - Watch as your contact form submissions flood your Discord with *"I am HACKER"* messages.  

3. **Deploy**  
   - Push to GitHub Pages, Vercel, or a Raspberry Pi hidden in your basement.  
   - Enable HTTPS *(or risk being *downgraded to HTTP by a bored attacker)*.

### **Contributing (AKA "Help Me Hide the Bugs")**  
**Option 1:**  
```bash
1. Fork this repo *(like a good Opensource Contributor)*.  
2. Code while listening to *Mr. Robot* OST.  
3. Submit a PR titled: *"Fixed typo (also added a backdoor)"*.  
```

**Option 2:**  
- Open an issue with the label **"Help, my VM just got pwned by my own portfolio!"**.  
--- 

**P.S.** If the contact form fails, just `ping` me on Discord. Or carrier pigeon. *(Latency may vary.)* üïäÔ∏è
